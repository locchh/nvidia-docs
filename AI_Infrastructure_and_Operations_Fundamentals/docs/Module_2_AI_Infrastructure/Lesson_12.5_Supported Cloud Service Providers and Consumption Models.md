# Supported Cloud Service Providers and Consumption Models

This subunit explores the most widely used cloud service providers (CSPs) and their various consumption models, helping you make an informed decision for your organization's cloud needs.

### NVIDIA and Cloud Service Providers
Accelerate your AI journey with NVIDIA's support for all major CSPs. NVIDIA has partnered with the leading cloud service providers to give you the freedom to deploy your AI workflows and solutions with the cloud service provider of your choice, including:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**

The NVIDIA cloud ecosystem is continually growing through ongoing collaborations with CSPs. Now you can seamlessly scale your AI workloads across different cloud environments, ensuring the highest levels of flexibility, reliability, and performance.

### Consumption Models
Now that we've covered the supported CSPs, let's delve into the various consumption models available across these platforms.

#### On-Premises Model
Let's start with the on-premises model as a baseline for comparing cloud consumption models. In a traditional on-premises deployment, the customer is responsible for managing the entire technology stack, from the data center and network infrastructure to storage, physical servers, virtualization, operating systems scaling, application code, and data configuration.

#### Cloud Delivery Models
Cloud delivery models primarily differ in the division of responsibilities between the customer and the cloud service provider for managing the full stack of resources required to run a workload. This contrasts with traditional on-premises infrastructure, where the customer is responsible for managing the entire data center.

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: 
   - Provides on-demand infrastructure services managed by the cloud service provider (CSP), with the customer responsible for elements beyond infrastructure.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: 
   - Builds on IaaS, allowing developers to focus on coding while the CSP manages both hardware and software.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: 
   - Delivers complete applications with the CSP handling all hosting components.

Importantly, the level of responsibility shifts between the CSP and the customer depending on the consumption model. 

### Understanding Your Cloud Strategy
To effectively leverage AI in the cloud, the first step is to understand your company's current cloud strategy and how they're using the cloud today. This includes:

- Understanding any enterprise cloud contracts in place
- The specific cloud services being used, such as IaaS or PaaS

This foundation will inform how AI can be leveraged to maximize benefits.

### Cloud Marketplace
With a solid grasp of the cloud consumption models, let's dive into one of the most popular options for getting started with cloud computing: the cloud marketplace.

#### What is a Cloud Marketplace?
A cloud marketplace provides a one-stop shop for cloud services. 

- **Easy Discovery**: 
  - Cloud marketplaces offer a centralized platform for discovering and exploring different cloud services, making it easier to find the right services for your project.

- **Streamlined Procurement**: 
  - With cloud marketplaces, you can quickly and easily purchase and deploy cloud services, eliminating the need for lengthy procurement processes.

- **Cost Savings**: 
  - Cloud marketplaces can help you save money by providing transparent pricing and allowing you to compare costs across different providers.

- **Increased Agility**: 
  - With cloud marketplaces, you can quickly and easily scale your cloud resources up or down to meet changing business needs, increasing your agility and responsiveness to market demands.

With cloud marketplaces, you can quickly and easily get started with AI in the cloud, streamline your procurement process, save money, and increase your agility in the ever-changing AI landscape.
