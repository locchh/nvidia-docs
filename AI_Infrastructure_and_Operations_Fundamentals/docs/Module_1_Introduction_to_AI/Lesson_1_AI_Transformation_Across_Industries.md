### Quote
A quote from Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA:  
"We are leveraging the capabilities of AI to perform intuitive tasks on a scale that is quite hard to imagine, and no industry can afford to or wants to miss out on the huge advantages that predictive analytics offers."  

AI has the transformative potential to infuse every industry due to its capacity to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and innovation. By leveraging advanced algorithms, machine learning, and data analytics, AI can streamline processes, automate tasks, and uncover valuable insights from vast data sets.  

### Examples of AI in Healthcare
- In **call centers**, AI can advance and accelerate many applications such as AI virtual agents, inside extraction, and sentiment analysis.
- In **retail**, AI can be used to provide insights for store analytics, such as store traffic trends, counts of customers with shopping baskets, aisle occupancy, and more.
- In **manufacturing**, AI can help design products, optimize production, improve quality control, reduce waste, and increase safety.  

AI has seamlessly woven itself into the fabric of our daily lives, leaving an indelible impact on how we work, communicate, and navigate the world. Many familiar technologies found in our day-to-day lives are powered by AI, and many more are being added to an ever-evolving landscape of possibilities.

The computer industry is currently undergoing transformative shifts that are reshaping the technological landscape. One notable trend is the explosion of generative AI, which is pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence applications. Generative AI models are demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, content creation, and problem-solving, integrating diverse data sources to create rich and contextually relevant outputs across various sensory modalities, such as text, images, and sound. We'll discuss generative AI in greater detail in the third unit of this course.

### AI in Drug Discovery
The drug discovery process has traditionally been expensive, long, and laborious. It is a $1.2 trillion industry with approximately $2 billion research and development investment per drug. These drugs normally go through more than ten years of development and have a 90% failure rate. By providing rich and diverse data sets that can be leveraged to train and validate AI models, AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by significantly impacting various stages of the drug development process.  

- **Digital biology** can be used to identify new drug targets, predict the efficacy and toxicity of drug candidates, and optimize the design of new drugs.  
- By using computational methods to model the interactions between drugs and biological systems, researchers can accelerate the drug discovery process and reduce the costs associated with traditional drug development.  

Lab automation, which is generating vast amounts of data in drug discovery, and the ability to process and analyze this data is becoming increasingly important for drug development. Advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques are being developed to help make sense of this data and accelerate the drug discovery process. AI and computing are revolutionizing drug discovery by enabling researchers to analyze and understand large amounts of data, develop more accurate models, and identify promising new drug candidates more quickly and efficiently.

### AI in Medical Devices
Medical devices are going through a revolution right now, where sensor information is augmented with software, advanced computing, and AI to do amazing things. Nowadays, medical devices can utilize continuous sensing, computation, and AI to detect, measure, predict, and guide high-risk precision medical operations. This evolution suggests that the healthcare sector is heading towards a more robotic approach, augmenting clinical care teams to meet demand, maximize efficiency, and enhance access to care.  

**Invenio Imaging** is a medical device company developing technology that enables surgeons to evaluate tissue biopsies in the operating room immediately after samples are collected, providing in just three minutes AI-accelerated insights that would otherwise take weeks to obtain from a pathology lab. Invenio uses a cluster of NVIDIA RTX GPUs to train AI neural networks with tens of millions of parameters on pathologist-annotated images. These models are layered on top of images, providing real-time image analysis, and allowing physicians to quickly determine what kinds of cancer cells are present in a biopsy image. With the ability to analyze different molecular subtypes of cancer within a tissue sample, doctors can predict how well a patient will respond to chemotherapy or determine whether a tumor has been successfully removed during surgery.

## AI in Financial Services
One of AI's incredible breakthroughs is the ability to identify patterns hidden in vast amounts of data at levels of precision, speed, and scale that were previously impossible to reach. This ability brings multiple benefits to the financial services industry, from enabling more intelligent trading to expanding credit and services to underserved people.

### Examples of AI in Financial Services
Let's view a couple of different examples of how large financial institutions are leveraging AI to reduce fraud and improve customer experience.  
1. **Deutsche Bank**: A leading global investment bank, Deutsche Bank is working with NVIDIA to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning on transformational AI applications. With NVIDIA's Omniverse platform and open computing platform for building and operating metaverse applications, Deutsche Bank is exploring how to engage with employees and customers more interactively, improving experiences using 3D virtual avatars to help employees navigate internal systems and respond to HR-related questions. Deutsche Bank and NVIDIA are testing a collection of large language models targeted at financial data called Financial Transformers or Finformers. These systems will achieve outcomes such as early warning signs on the counterparty of a financial transaction, faster data retrieval, and identifying data quality issues.
  
2. **American Express**: Credit and bank cards are a major target for fraud. To thwart fraudulent activity, American Express, which handles more than 8 billion transactions a year, leverages deep learning through the NVIDIA GPU computing platform. Using advanced AI models to detect anomalous patterns and transactions, American Express implemented an enhanced real-time fraud detection system to improve accuracy and better protect its customers and merchants while operating within a tight two-millisecond latency requirement.

- **Daniel**: CATS is playing tonight. Can you give me two tickets for Saturday night?  
- **AI Assistant**: Yes, I can. You have arrived at your destination. Please park the vehicle.  
- **Daniel**: Okay, finding a parking spot.

### Production Challenges
Vehicle production is a colossal undertaking, requiring thousands of parts and workers moving in harmony. Any supply chain or production issues can lead to costly delays. Additionally, when automakers roll out a new model, they must reconfigure the layout of production plans to account for the new vehicle design. This process can take significant portions of the factory offline, posing manufacturing challenges for existing vehicles.  

**Mercedes-Benz** is digitizing its production process using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to design and plan manufacturing and assembly facilities. NVIDIA Omniverse is an open 3D development platform enabling enterprises and institutions across all industries to build and operate digital twins for industrial and scientific use cases. By tapping into NVIDIA AI and metaverse technologies, the automaker can create feedback loops to reduce waste, decrease energy consumption, and continuously enhance quality.  

Mercedes-Benz is preparing to manufacture its new EV platform at its plant in Rastatt, Germany. Operations experts are simulating new production processes in Omniverse, which can be used alongside existing vehicle production. This virtual workflow also allows the automaker to quickly react to supply chain disruptions, reconfiguring the assembly line as needed. Using NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, Mercedes-Benz is building intelligent, sustainable factories that improve efficiency, reduce waste, and continually enhance vehicle quality.
