### vGPU Foundation

Before we get into AI frameworks and the way NVIDIA provides and supports these frameworks, let's take a few minutes to briefly cover vGPU as a foundational technology. The workplace is experiencing a pandemic disruption that is changing the form and perspective of how we work. The adoption of digital technologies has helped organizations respond to unprecedented challenges and increasingly make a mobile workforce more prevalent.

By 2030, end-user computing is expected to grow to $20 billion, with 40% of storage and compute shifting towards service-based models. However, to build an enhanced digital workspace for the post-pandemic recovery and beyond, we must move beyond defensive short-term models and focus on sustainable, resilient operating methods. Improved user experience paired with security stands at the forefront of the corporate agenda. In fact, 53% of IT executives report their companies are increasing investment in digital transformation, while 49% are looking to improve efficiencies.

This is where NVIDIA virtual GPU technology comes into play, allowing IT to deliver graphics-rich virtual experiences across their user base, whether deploying office productivity applications for knowledge workers or providing engineers and designers with high-performance virtual workstations to access professional design and visualization applications. IT can deliver an appealing user experience and maintain the productivity and efficiency of their users.

Application and desktop virtualization solutions have been around for a long time, but their number one point of failure tends to be user experience. The reason is simple: when applications and desktops were first virtualized, GPUs were not part of the mix. This meant that all of the capture, encoding, and rendering traditionally done on a GPU in a physical device was being handled by the CPU in the host.

Enter NVIDIA's virtual GPU or vGPU solution. It enables IT to virtualize a GPU and share it across multiple virtual machines (VMs). This not only improves performance for existing VDI environments, but also opens up a whole new set of use cases that can leverage this technology. With our portfolio of virtual GPU solutions, we enable accelerated productivity across a wide range of users and applications.

Knowledge workers benefit from an improved experience with office applications, browsers, high-definition video, including video conferencing like Zoom, WebEx, and Skype. For creative and technical professionals, NVIDIA enables virtual access to professional applications typically run on physical workstations, including CAD applications or design applications such as Revit and Maya. It enables GIS apps like Esri, ArcGIS Pro, oil and gas apps like Petrol, financial services like Bloomberg, healthcare apps like Epic, or manufacturing apps like CATIA, Siemens NX, and SolidWorks, to name a few.

Our virtual software is available for on-premises data centers and also in the cloud. NVIDIA Virtual PC (VPC) and virtual apps software are designed for knowledge and business workers, while NVIDIA RTX Virtual Workstation is for creative and technical professionals such as engineers, architects, and designers. We have a series of courses to walk you through each software offering; please review the virtualization sales curriculum for more detailed information.

### Frameworks for Deep Learning

Let's review how NVIDIA virtual GPU software enables multiple virtual machines to have direct access to a single physical GPU while using the same NVIDIA drivers that our customers deploy on non-virtualized operating systems. 

On the left-hand side, we have a standard VMware ESXi host. VMware has done a great job over the years virtualizing CPU workloads. However, certain tasks are more efficiently handled by dedicated hardware, such as GPUs, which offer enhanced graphics and accelerated computing capabilities. 

On the right side, from the bottom up, we have a server with a GPU running the ESXi hypervisor. When the NVIDIA vGPU Manager software (VIB) is installed on the host server, we're able to assign vGPU profiles to individual VMs. NVIDIA branded drivers are then installed into the guest OS, providing a high-end user experience. This software enables multiple VMs to share a single GPU, or if there are multiple GPUs in the server, they can be aggregated so that a single VM can access multiple GPUs. This GPU-enabled environment provides for unprecedented performance while enabling support for more users on a server because work that was done by the CPU can now be offloaded to the GPU.

Most people understand the benefits of GPU virtualizationâ€”the ability to divide up GPU resources and share them across multiple virtual machines to deliver the best possible performance. But there are many other benefits delivered by NVIDIA virtual GPU software, included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise suite, which go beyond just GPU sharing. 

With NVIDIA vGPU software, IT can deliver bare-metal performance for compute workloads with minimal overhead while running virtualized. Integrations with partners like VMware provide a complete lifecycle approach to operational management, from infrastructure rightsizing to proactive management and issue remediation. These integrations allow IT to use the same familiar management tools from hypervisor and leading monitoring software vendors for deep insights into GPU usage.

NVIDIA vGPU supports live migration of accelerated workloads without interruption to end users, allowing for business continuity and workload balancing. The ability to flexibly allocate GPU resources means that IT can better utilize the resources in their data center. Since virtualization enables all data to remain securely in the data center, the solution helps to ensure infrastructure and data security.

### Overview of Software Stack

Now, let's explore deep learning. We'll start with a brief review of what it is, then walk through an AI workflow. From there, we'll talk about the AI software stack and CUDA-X.

Deep learning is a subclass of machine learning. It uses neural networks to train a model using very large datasets in the range of terabytes or more of data. Neural networks are algorithms that mimic the human brain in understanding complex patterns. Labeled data is a set of data with labels that help the neural network learn. In the example here, the labels are the objects in the images: cars and trucks. The errors that the classifier makes on the training data are used to incrementally improve the network structure.

Once the neural network-based model is trained, it can make predictions on new images. If the training was done correctly, the network will be able to apply its feature representation to correctly classify similar classes in different situations.

To understand the AI ecosystem, you have to start with the workflow. The first step is the process of preparing raw data and making it suitable for the machine learning model. Examples of tools for this are NVIDIA RAPIDS and the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark. Once the data is processed, we move on to the training phase. This is where we teach the model to interpret data. Examples of tools for this are PyTorch, the NVIDIA toolkit, and TensorFlow.

Next, we refine the data through optimization. An example tool for this is TensorRT. Finally, we deploy the model, making it available for systems to receive data and return predictions. The NVIDIA Triton Inference Server allows the simple deployment of scalable AI models in production.

So what are frameworks? Frameworks are designed to provide higher-level building blocks that make it easy for data scientists and domain experts in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and other areas to design, train, and validate AI models. They can be an interface library or tool that allows developers to build models more easily and quickly.

Data scientists use frameworks to create models for a variety of use cases such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. For example, MXNet is a modern open-source deep learning framework used to train and deploy deep neural networks. It is scalable, allowing for fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages. The MXNet library is portable and can scale to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries, NumPy and SciPy. TensorFlow is a popular open-source software library for data flow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library and is commonly used for deep learning applications. NVIDIA Isaac Lab is a lightweight application built on Isaac Sim for robot learning. Isaac Lab optimizes for reinforcement, imitation, and transfer learning and can train all types of robot embodiments.

The diagram shows the software stack for deep learning. The hardware consists of a system, which can be a workstation or

 data center. The NVIDIA GPUs provide the core compute capability. There are then system and framework libraries, and finally the various AI frameworks.

CUDA-X AI leverages NVIDIA CUDA to enable developers to scale their machine learning and deep learning workloads across multiple GPUs. CUDA-X is a collection of GPU-accelerated libraries that provide essential components for building AI applications.

CUDA-X consists of many libraries, including cuDNN for deep neural networks, cuBLAS for dense linear algebra, and TensorRT for high-performance inference. Together, they optimize workloads to achieve the highest performance for training and inference.

The CUDA-X libraries are optimized for a variety of workloads, providing acceleration for data processing, neural network training, and inference. This allows developers to take full advantage of GPU performance for AI applications.

To support these applications, the CUDA-X AI software stack is designed to be interoperable with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet, allowing developers to leverage their existing workflows and tools while maximizing performance.
