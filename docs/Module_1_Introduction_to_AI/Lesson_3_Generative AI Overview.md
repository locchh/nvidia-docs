## Understanding Generative AI
In the previous unit, we learned about the AI process that allows us to reach generative AI, but let's get a better understanding of exactly what it is. Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating data or content, such as images, text, and multimedia based on patterns and examples from a given dataset. 

What sets generative AI apart is its versatility, enabling it to perform a wide array of tasks beyond text and chat-based applications. These systems can generate diverse forms of content, including realistic images, videos, music, and even entire virtual environments, by learning from and synthesizing patterns in the input data. Its adaptability to diverse data types and applications underscores its potential to transform multiple industries and augment human capabilities across a wide spectrum of tasks.

## Industry Impact
Generative AI is making inroads into every industry, transforming traditional practices, and bringing forth unprecedented operational efficiency and innovation. In finance, it enhances fraud detection, personalized banking, and provides valuable investment insights. Within healthcare, it powers molecule simulation, drug discovery, and clinical trial data analysis. Retail benefits from personalized shopping, automated catalog descriptions, and automatic price optimization. In manufacturing, it transforms factory simulation, product design, and predictive maintenance. These are just some examples of the innovations brought by generative AI.

## Examples of Generative AI
- **DALL-E** creates realistic images from text descriptions. It can be used for image synthesis tasks such as image captioning, image editing, or image manipulation.
- **Edify** is a diffusion model for synthesizing images given text, generating photorealistic images corresponding to any input text prompt.

- **NVIDIA-GPT** is a family of production-ready large language models (LLMs) that can be tuned to build enterprise generative AI applications, capable of performing a range of tasks from creating product descriptions to answering customer queries and writing code.
- **GPT-4** gives applications the ability to create human-like text and content, images, music, and more, and answer questions in a conversational manner.

## Training Foundation Models
We just saw examples of foundation models. Let's now discuss how they are trained. The large language models (LLMs) powering the advances in generative AI represent a significant turning point. They have cracked the code on language complexity, enabling machines to learn context, infer intent, and be independently creative, and they can also be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks.

A foundation model is trained on a large amount of unlabeled data—that is, data that does not have any predefined categories, labels, or annotations, such as raw text, images, audio, or video. Unlabeled data is abundant and diverse and can be obtained from various sources such as the Internet, social media platforms, or proprietary datasets. A foundation model trained on text data can be used to solve problems related to natural language processing, such as question answering and information extraction. The possibilities for what a foundation model can generate are endless and depend on the creativity and ingenuity of the users who apply them to different problems and domains.

## Transformer Architecture
Large language models utilize a specialized neural network known as the transformer to grasp patterns and relationships within textual data. They undergo pre-training on extensive text datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. The goal of the language model is to predict the next word based on the preceding words in a context. While this example pertains to the English language, the prediction could apply to a computer programming language or another language.

The model generates text one word at a time based on an input prompt provided by the user. For example, with the input prompt "write a review about an Italian restaurant I visited and enjoyed," the input prompt is broken down into smaller tokens that are then fed back into the model. The model predicts the next word in the sequence based on the tokens it has received. This process continues until the user stops providing input or the model reaches a predetermined stopping point.

LLMs are constructed based on tokens, which represent the smallest units of meaning in a language. Tokens encompass words, characters, subwords, or other symbols representing linguistic elements. The transformer model architecture empowers the LLM to comprehend and recognize relationships and connections between tokens and concepts using a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns a score, commonly referred to as a weight, to a given item or token to determine the relationship.

## Computational Efficiency
Generative AI models often involve complex mathematical operations and require intensive computations. GPUs are designed to be highly effective for parallel processing. This parallelism enables faster training and inference times for generative AI models compared to using traditional CPUs. GPUs excel in parallel processing matrix operations, memory capacity, and memory bandwidth, making them an ideal choice for powering up generative AI. They significantly accelerate the training and inference processes, enable working with large-scale models, and support real-time applications. For example, ChatGPT was trained on 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs for weeks.

## Challenges in Adoption
While generative AI offers significant benefits, including increased efficiency and cost savings, its adoption does not come without challenges. To successfully implement such solutions, you will need to address various technical, ethical, and regulatory issues. It's our responsibility to build using guardrails or rules to mitigate inappropriate outcomes.

### Key Challenges:
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Generative AI use cases in the healthcare and financial sectors should be monitored very closely to forestall any money-related or sensitive data leakages.
- **IP Rights and Copyright**: Generative AI platforms should mitigate copyright infringement of the creator's work.
- **Bias, Errors, and Limitations**: Generative AI is just as prone to biases as humans are, because in many ways, it is trained on our own biases.
- **Ethical Implications**: Determining responsibility for the outputs of generative AI can be challenging. If AI systems generate harmful content, it may be unclear who bears responsibility—the developers, the users, or the technology itself.
- **Malevolent Activities**: There is no state-of-the-art know-how that wrongdoers can't put to their evil uses, and generative AI is not an exception, where fraudulent scams of various kinds can be created.

## Practical Applications in Enterprise
Having gained a deeper understanding of generative AI, let's now explore its practical applications in the enterprise. Generative AI is a powerful branch of artificial intelligence that holds immense potential for addressing various challenges faced by enterprises. While many customers have previously explored AI using traditional classification, named entity recognition (NER), and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there's a gradual migration towards large language models for these familiar tasks.

As organizations become more acquainted with LLMs, they increasingly recognize the value of generative AI and expand its application across various workloads. Generative AI produces new content based on patterns and trends learned from training data. Traditional AI, on the other hand, focuses on detecting patterns, making decisions, honing analytics, classifying data, and detecting fraud. Generative AI and traditional AI are not mutually exclusive but complementary.

## Customization Spectrum
This chart shows the customization spectrum that different enterprise customers would need based on their generative AI use cases. The largest category on the left pertains to generative AI as a service, likely the one familiar to many through experiences with ChatGPT. Here, you input a prompt and receive a corresponding response. If the response is unsatisfactory, you can modify the prompt to obtain a new one. While the model remains constant, it receives input, refinement, or reinforcement to assist in delivering a more accurate answer.

The next level, moderate customization, is where enterprises will add additional parameters to the existing pre-trained model and slightly tune it. This moderate customization still requires infrastructure, expertise, and investment. The next one is extensive customization. Here’s where customers build their own foundational models. They require extensive fine-tuning and even more investment in infrastructure and AI expertise. Building foundational models from scratch requires a lot of data and compute resources, making it a very costly process. It's often large technology companies, research institutions, and well-funded startups that have the resources and expertise to undertake such projects.

Customizing a pre-trained model, on the other hand, requires less data, resources, and expertise. It involves feeding the model with domain-specific data tasks and adjusting the model parameters accordingly. It's less resource-intensive, but also requires some knowledge of the model capabilities, the data format, and the evaluation metrics. As a result, many organizations choose the more cost-effective approach of leveraging existing foundational models like those offered by AI research companies and fine-tune them to their specific needs.

## Investment and Infrastructure
While generative AI shows tremendous promise for delivering business value, companies must also make substantial investments to build custom LLMs to meet their needs. Building custom LLMs requires massive amounts of training data. To get these models to understand, predict, and generate human-like text, we need to feed them with a substantial corpus of diverse and high-quality data. This presents a challenge in terms of not only data collection but also its curation, storage, and management.

The sheer scale of computations required for training these models is immense. It demands a robust,

 large-scale computing infrastructure, which is expensive. Implementing LLMs requires more than just the right hardware; it also necessitates the right software. Organizations need tools that address both training and inference challenges. From algorithm development to accelerating inference on a distributed infrastructure, LLMs are complex and sophisticated. They require a deep understanding of AI, machine learning, and data science principles. Building and fine-tuning these models require teams with a high degree of technical expertise in these areas, which can be difficult to find and retain.

## Key Steps to Deployment
Embarking on the journey of generative AI involves some key steps. In essence, deploying generative AI in an organization is not just about the technology, but also about aligning it with business goals, team capabilities, data strategies, infrastructure readiness, and a commitment to responsible AI.

1. **Identify the Business Opportunity**: Focus on use cases with substantial business impact and ones that can be enhanced by your unique data. These opportunities form the bedrock of your generative AI strategy.
  
2. **Build Out Domain and AI Teams**: Identify your internal resources and couple them with AI expertise from partners and application providers. Form an interdisciplinary team that understands both your business and the AI landscape.
  
3. **Analyze Data for Training and Customization**: Acquire, refine, and protect your data to build data-intensive foundation models or customize existing ones.
  
4. **Invest in Accelerated Infrastructure**: Assess your current infrastructure, architecture, and operating model while carefully considering associated costs and energy consumption. The right infrastructure will enable efficient and effective deployment of your AI solutions.
  
5. **Develop a Plan for Responsible AI**: Leverage tools and best practices to ensure that your AI models and applications uphold ethical standards and operate responsibly.

- **Data Acquisition**: Collect and prepare the data that will be used to train and fine-tune the LLM. The data can come from various sources such as public datasets, web scraping, user-generated content, or proprietary data. It's important that the data is diverse and representative of the target domain.

- **Data Curation**: This phase involves cleaning, filtering, and organizing the data to be used to train and fine-tune the LLM.

- **Pre-Training Phase**: Expose the model to a vast corpus of text data to facilitate the learning of language patterns, relationships, and representations. This phase typically incorporates a foundational model as the starting point.

- **Customization**: Adapt a generic model to the specific requirements of a given task or domain, thereby improving its accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness.

- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance and effectiveness of a machine learning model by measuring how well the model has learned from the training data and how accurately it can make predictions on unseen or new data.

- **Deployment**: Once trained, the model is deployed for inference, where it processes input data and produces output, such as classifications, predictions, or recommendations, depending on the specific task it was trained for.

- **Adding Guardrails**: Implementing guardrails for an LLM is crucial for fostering responsible AI practices and mitigating the risks associated with the misuse or misinterpretation of the generated text. It helps ensure ethical, safe, and responsible use of the model.
