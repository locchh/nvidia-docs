## Cluster Management and Monitoring Overview
In this unit, we'll begin with an overview of cluster management and monitoring. We will discuss infrastructure provisioning and management, as well as monitoring for resources and workloads. Finally, we will provide an overview of NVIDIA's Base Command Manager software.

## Infrastructure Provisioning
There are three main concepts to consider when managing AI infrastructure. 

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: This is the process of setting up and configuring hardware, including servers, switches, storage, and other components of the AI cluster. 
   
   Once the infrastructure is installed in the data center or procured in the cloud, it needs to be provisioned before it can be used. The installed hardware may not have the latest or correct versions of software or firmware by default. The necessary versions depend on the components in the data center and the workload needs. 

   In preparation for provisioning, the correct versions of software and firmware must be determined and downloaded. Once retrieved, the systems can be updated, which may include the operating system, GPU drivers, networking drivers, management tools, and any applications needed to run on the servers, switches, and storage. This process can also include updating firmware for the hardware. When provisioning is complete, the compute nodes, GPUs, storage, and networking should be ready for workloads.

   Several tools are available for provisioning servers and systems, including:
   - **Ansible**: An open-source command-line IT automation software that can configure systems and deploy software.
   - **Terraform**: An infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define both cloud and on-premises resources.
   - **Foreman**: An open-source project that helps system administrators manage servers throughout their lifecycle, from provisioning and configuration to orchestration and monitoring.

## Resource Management and Monitoring
The second concept is **Resource Management and Monitoring**. Managing and monitoring resources in a data center go hand in hand, as standard maintenance tasks must be performed for the systems. Monitoring provides insights into which systems might need attention beyond regular maintenance.

For compute nodes, monitoring should include the overall system health as well as metrics on special hardware like GPUs. Management tasks involve installing patches and updates for security flaws, keeping firmware up to date, maintaining drivers, and replacing failing components. 

Network aspects, such as congestion, connection quality, and overall connectivity, should be monitored to identify potential network issues, including cable degradation or lost connections. As workloads change or the cluster grows, networking topology, bandwidth, or other factors may need upgrades. 

In addition to compute nodes and networks, other cluster components like storage and maintenance nodes require monitoring and management. This includes tracking disk space usage and the health of management nodes, ensuring that management node software is updated, and authorizing users for cluster access.

Some tools used for management and monitoring include:
- **Redfish**: A standard for secure management of servers, networks, storage devices, and other infrastructure.
- **DCGM Exporter Tool**: A tool based on Go APIs to NVIDIA DCGM for gathering GPU metrics and monitoring workloads in clusters.
- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring system that collects and stores metrics, often used in conjunction with **Grafana** for visualizing time series data.

## Workload Management and Monitoring
The third concept is **Workload Management and Monitoring**, which includes ensuring that workloads receive the necessary resources. Monitoring involves checking the efficiency of resource usage, including whether GPUs and CPUs are being properly utilized and addressing any memory or storage concerns. 

Workload management also requires scheduling jobs on compute nodes, stopping jobs that encounter issues, and restarting failed jobs. Monitoring the status of jobs provides results and allows for resource reallocation back to the cluster.

Common workload management tools include:
- **Kubernetes**: An open-source tool for managing and orchestrating containerized workloads, which can work with NVIDIA GPUs and integrate with advanced schedulers.
- **Jupyter Lab**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing computational documents, which can be launched and run from within containers.
- **Slurm**: A scheduling tool used to simplify resource sharing on large AI and HPC clusters, capable of running interactive and batch jobs with resource reservations and quality of service settings.

## Base Command Manager Overview
In the final section, we will give an overview of NVIDIA's Base Command Manager (BCM), a comprehensive software system for managing an AI data center. BCM handles infrastructure provisioning, user access, workload management, resource monitoring, networking setup, security, DNS, and ensures cluster integrity. 

BCM automates server management and updates to prevent server drift. It can deploy Kubernetes and Slurm, streamline Jupyter Lab setup, and includes built-in job monitoring and metrics for GPUs and other cluster resources.

The key value propositions of Base Command Manager are:
1. Accelerating time to value by simplifying infrastructure setup and workload provisioning.
2. Reducing complexity and effort through automation of management and operations.
3. Enabling agility with streamlined support for various workloads through dynamic resource allocation.

All these benefits support the entire AI team, from IT to data scientists to business owners.
